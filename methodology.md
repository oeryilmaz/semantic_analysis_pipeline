# NLP Pipeline for Semantic Analysis: Technical Design and Methodology

## Purpose and Applications

I developed this pipeline during my PhD in Economics at ETH Zurich to explore how statistical methods from economics could complement NLP techniques. The goal was to provide interpretable and statistically validated insights into thematic relationships in text data.

While initially designed for academic research, the pipeline's statistical rigor makes it valuable for business applications. For example, in e-commerce, where decisions often rely on understanding complex customer perceptions, the pipeline can:

* **Analyze Product Relationships**: Uncover how customers conceptually connect different product attributes by analyzing reviews and descriptions. This analysis reveals which features customers naturally associate together, backed by statistical validation that quantifies the strength and reliability of these associations.

* **Enhance Search and Recommendations**: Improve product discovery by identifying statistically significant semantic relationships between search terms and product attributes. Rather than relying solely on keyword matching, the pipeline can reveal deeper patterns in how customers describe and search for products.

By combining NLP with econometric validation, this pipeline enables data-driven decisions with clear statistical support, whether in research or industry applications.

## Core Components and Statistical Approach

### Pipeline Architecture and Modularity
The pipeline implements a modular design where each component operates independently while maintaining clear interfaces for data flow. This modularity enables flexible customization and reuse across different analytical needs. The key components are:

- **Text Preprocessing**: Efficient handling of large corpora with configurable parameters.
- **Embedding Training**: Word2Vec embeddings with skip-gram architecture for semantic representations.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Validation of thematic relationships and comparative analysis across categories using statistical validations. 

### Statistical Validation Framework
The statistical validation framework applies econometric methods to semantic analysis, providing interpretable metrics for understanding thematic relationships. This approach accounts for the stochastic uncertainty inherent in NLP methods, allowing for more rigorous data-driven decisions.

- Basic significance tests of semantic relationships while accounting for sample size and variance.
- Effect size quantifies the magnitude of semantic differences.
- Comprehensive distribution analysis (mean, skewness, kurtosis) provides additional insights.
- Identifying word pairs with the strongest and weakest semantic relationships within and across categories helps uncover key patterns and outliers in the data.

### Customizable Semantic Categories
The pipeline strength lies in its ability to adapt to any domain-specific interest through the customizable semantic categories in `config.py`. Simply adapt the categories, adjust the corpus and run the analysis. One could adapt it for:

- E-commerce: Categories like 'pricing,' 'durability,' and 'customer satisfaction' can reveal patterns in product reviews.
- Policy Analysis: Categories like 'governance,' 'rights,' and 'economy' can uncover thematic trends in legislative or institutional discourse.
- Healthcare: Categories like 'symptoms,' 'treatments,' and 'outcomes' can be applied to medical research text.

## Design Decisions and Trade-offs

### Why Word2Vec?
- Provides static, interpretable embeddings ideal for statistical analysis.
- Simpler and more efficient than contextual models like BERT for thematic analysis.
- Trade-offs: Reduced ability to capture context-dependent meanings.

### Skip-gram vs CBOW
- Unlike CBOW, the skip-gram algorithm learns word meanings by predicting what context words typically appear around each target word. This directly models how words are used in context - a key principle in linguistics that similar words appear in similar contexts. For the toy example (see `config.py`), this helps capture how key concepts like "rights" or "governance" are typically discussed and framed.
- Trade-offs: Slower training compared to CBOW. But efficiency is irrelevant if it doesn't get us to our goal. 

## Limitations and Future Work
- Static embeddings miss contextual meaning variations (I might use BERT-models in future models)
- Parametric assumptions may not hold for the statistical tests I use
- Robustness tests using bootstrapping approaches (sampling on the article-level)

## Conclusion
This pipeline combines NLP and econometric methods to deliver interpretable, statistically validated insights. Its modularity, customizability, and rigorous validation framework make it a practical tool for industry applications. This pipeline equips users with reliable metrics to make data-driven decisions.
